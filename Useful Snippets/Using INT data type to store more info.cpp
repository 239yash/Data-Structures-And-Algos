/*

Let's say, you are having a problem where you have to operate on binary numbers 0/1 only.
Now, problem asked you to store some more information or lets say you have to store some extra info. 
without changing the binary numbers. ints but only the 1-bit is used, I use the 2-bit to store the new state.
At the end, replace the old state with the new state by shifting all values one bit to the right.
